# myBUDDY OS (LD46) [Theme: Keep It Alive]

## Description
Clippy has been replaced with the BRAND NEW myBUDDY OS. He's a helpful computer friend that does everything from running your computer and managing your network to making your dinner and filing your taxes. But watch out! There are things out there that want to harm myBUDDY and steal your data. Can you keep him alive and fend off the attackers?

## Breakdown 
1. Tamagotchi-esque game
2. Multiple enemy types
    - Viruses
    - Worms
    - Spam email
    - Malware
    - Hackers
    - ~~Tracking Cookies~~
    - Crypto Miners
    - ~~Auditors~~
    - ~~Compliance Checks~~
3. Power ups
    - Warranties (increases max health and refills health)
    - CPU upgrades (Increase attacks against Worms)
    - ~~Cloud servers~~
    - RAM upgrades (Increase attacks against Malware)
    - Anti-virus (Increase attacks against Viruses)

4. Win/Loss scenarios
    - There is no winning state in this game. myBUDDY is strictly a digital pet that you have to protect. Losing is basically just letting myBUDDY die. If myBuddy dies, you have to quit. Also, your save data is wiped out. :smile:

## TODO List
- [x] Game flow/layout (menus/options/controls/etc)
- [x] Do we want cutscenes for collecting a new power-up? (No)
- [x] Do we want bosses? (No. this is just a Tamagotchi)
- [x] Flesh out enemy types (What do they do? What are their attacks/special powers?)
- [x] Flesh out power-ups (What do they do? What do they look like? Do they add to the overall power of myBUDDY or are they ephemeral?)
- [x] Art and animations for myBUDDY (IDLE/WALK/THINK)
- [x] Art and animations for each enemy
- [x] Art and animations for each power-up

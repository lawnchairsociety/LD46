# myBUDDY OS (LD46) [Theme: Keep It Alive]

## Description
Clippy has been replaced with the BRAND NEW myBUDDY OS. He's a helpful computer friend that does everything from running your computer and managing your network to making your dinner and filing your taxes. But watch out! There are things out there that want to harm myBUDDY and steal your data. Can you keep him alive and fend off the attackers?

## Breakdown 
1. Tamagotchi-esque game
2. Multiple enemy types
    - Viruses
    - Worms
    - Spam email
    - Malware
    - Hackers
    - Tracking Cookies
    - Crypto Miners
    - Auditors
    - Compliance Checks
3. Power ups
    - CPU upgrades
    - Cloud servers
    - RAM upgrades
    - Anti-virus
    - Email filters
    - AI
    - Tensor cores
4. Win/Loss scenarios
    - There is no winning state in this game. myBUDDY is strictly a digital pet that you have to protect. Losing is basically just letting myBUDDY die. If myBuddy dies, you will be given a menu to create a new myBUDDY and the game starts over.
5. Achievements (if time allows) [Ideas for names?]

    - 128 Worms Cleaned
